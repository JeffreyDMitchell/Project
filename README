HOMEWORK 5: LIGHTING

    Added lighting to my sword. Diffuse and ambient light contributions can be tweaked in the parameters as described below.

    Tweak the parameters to change the properties of the sword. Normals are generated dynamically with blade geometry!

Running the program:
    makefile produces an executable named "hw5"
    run with ./hw5
