FINAL PROJECT: PROGRESS UPDATE

Instructions:
Generally, the following commands should be used to compile and run the program:

    make clean && make -k && ./project

My system has both intel integrated graphics, and a dedicated nvidia GPU. To get openGL to make use of the proper adapter, I also set a few environment variables:

    __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia

Bringing the entire command to:

    make clean && make -j && __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia ./project

NOTICE:
I only have regular access to a ubuntu system. I cannot guarantee that it will compile or run on Mac OS, as I do not have one to test with. I have used the professors Makefile, but have not paid any special attention to any systems other than linux. If it compiles at all, it will likely run without fast optimization and openmp, meaning performance will be poor. I will try to get my hand on these systems for the final submission.

Program controls:
    eq ------------------ decrease/increase FOV
    uo ------------------ decrease/increase player height
    wasd ---------------- rotate scene/view
    Arrow Up/Down ------- select parameters
    Arrow Left/Right ---- modify parameters
